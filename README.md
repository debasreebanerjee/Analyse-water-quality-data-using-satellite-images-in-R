# Analyse-water-quality-data-from-satellite-images-using-RStudio

### Introduction
Gilgel Gibe III hydropower dam, which is constructed on the Omo River in Ethiopia, was 
predicted to bring catastrophic impact on the water quality, ecology and hydrology of Lake
Turkana by previous studies. The effect of the dam on the water quality of Lake Turkana was
analyzed in this study using data retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor.

### Research aim and objectives
The main aim and objectives of this research are as follows:

Aim:

• Analyze the effect of Gibe III dam on the water quality of Lake Turkana.

Objectives:

• Evaluate the correlation between in-situ water quality parameters and Landsat 8
reflectance bands and band ratios.

• Develop regression models to determine water quality parameters from different
spectral reflectance measured by the Landsat 8 satellite sensors.

• Retrieve the concentration of Chl-a from the Landsat 8 satellite imagery to investigate
changes over time.

• Use statistical analysis to quantify the change in concentration of Chl-a to determine
the effect of the Gibe III dam on the water quality of Lake Turkana.

### Methodology
Tools used

The Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance images were processed and analyzed using RStudio.

### Key findings
A strong relationship was found between the measured and estimated chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)
concentration (R2 = 0.95). Timeseries analysis of Chl-a concentration showed that a drastic
change happened just after the dam began filling. Although the concentration of Chl-a
improved on the subsequent year but statistical analyses showed that it remains below than
that of before the development of the dam.
